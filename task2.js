import { sleep } from './promises.js'

/*
Create a function that prints "Done" after 2 seconds to the console.

- Right now use the sleep function to accomplish this, it is already provided for your convenience.
  
  The sleep function returns a Promise. It fulfills after the given amount of milliseconds, so this
  function basically waits N milliseconds asynchronously.

  syntax: sleep(waitingTime: number): Promise
  example: sleep(5000)

- Use the `then` syntax.

Goal: Practice the fulfilled then syntax without return value.

Hints:
  -  https://javascript.info/promise-basics#consumers-then-catch

Questions:
  - What is a Promise?
  - What properties / methods it has? 
  - How the control flow looks like? What will be executed when?
  - Where have you used promises recently?
  - What is the difference between a fetch call and this sleep call?
