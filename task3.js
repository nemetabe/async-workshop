import { sleep } from "./promises.js"

/*
  Rewrite your function from the previous task to the async - await syntax.

  - Use the sleep function.

  Goal: Practice the async await syntax with a fulfilled promise without return value.

  Hints:
    - https://javascript.info/async-await

  Questions:
    - Compare the then and the async-await syntax?
    - What kind of variable will be returned when we call an async function? 
    - How an async function is executed, when it reach the await keyword? 
    - Will the other parts of the code will run while the code is waiting here?
