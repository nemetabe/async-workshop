/*
Create a function that waits 2 seconds, and then log "Done" to the console.

- Use non blocking technique, it can be anything.
- Run this file with: node task1.js

Goal: Create an async flow

Hints:
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout

Questions:
  - How setTimeout changed the control flow? If we put a console log after the 
    setTimeout call, what will be executed first, the Done console log or this one?
