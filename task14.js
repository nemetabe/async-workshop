import { readFile } from 'fs/promises'

/*
  - Create a function, that opens the quotes.txt and read its content and log it to the console.
  - You can choose between the then and the async-await syntax.
  - If the there is an error during the read, write a fridenly error message to the console. 
  (you can test it, if you try to open a non existent file)
  - use node.js's readFile() function's promise version.
    
    syntax: readFile(path: string, encoding: string): Promise<string>
    example; readFile('./some-file.txt', 'utf8')

  Goal: Apply the promise theory to real life library usage with error handling.
