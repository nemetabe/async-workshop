import { sleepTwoSecs } from "./promises.js";

/*
  - Create a function that waits 2 seconds, then logs "Step 1" to the console.
  - Then waits 2 seconds more and logs "Step 2" to the console.
  - Use the sleepTwoSecs() function.

    The sleepTwoSecs() function returns a Promise. It fulfills after 2 secs.
    It does not have any arguments.

    syntax: sleepTwoSecs(): Promise
    example: sleepTwoSecs()
  
  
  - Use the `then` syntax



  Goal: Chain Promises sequentially.

  Hints:
    - https://javascript.info/promise-chaining (first chapter)

  Questions:
    - What will be happened, if I return a Promise from the then method's 
      callback function?
