import { getRandomNumberSlowly } from "./promises.js";

/*
  - Create a function that generates 3 random number. Log this 3 numbers to the console.
  - This time use only the getRandomNumberSlowly() function.
  - It is indentical to the getRandomNumber, but waits a little bit.
  - Feel free to choose between the `then` or the async-await syntax. 

  Goal: Practice chained promises, prepare for the concurrent promises.
